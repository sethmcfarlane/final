## pet egg
a pet egg

## summary
I will build an interactive pet egg that changes lights depending on the interactions around it (picked up, placed on the ground, shook, etc).

## component parts
It will be 3D printed and laser cut with acrylic to create a soft diffusion of light. An arduino will be inside the egg to control the lights.

## challenges
Getting the parts to fit together. I need to laser cut and sand the acrylic to the right size to get it flush with the 3D print.

## timeline
Week 1: wire and code

Week 2: print and cut

Week 3: present
